xcpy - interfaces with external programs from within Bruker-TopSpin

USAGE
xcpy
xcpy [OPTIONS]
xcpy [OPTIONS] [SCRIPTNAME]

INSTALLATION
1. Copy (or symlink) this file to the following directory:
<topspin_location>/exp/stan/nmr/py/user/
2. If you now type 'xcpy' on the command line within Topspin,
this documentation should pop up
3. A configuration file needs to be written out so that xcpy
knows the location of the CPython executable and a folder where
the .py scripts are located. This can be done by 'xcpy -s'. This
can be rewritten at any time point using the same command.


DESCRIPTION
xcpy supports running external scripts via Jython (subprocess module)
that ships with Topspin. Currently, it allows only external CPython
programs to run. By default, it passes the current folder, expno and procno
to the external CPython program (if available).


OPTIONS
-h, --help: Brings up this docstring. Also brings it up when no other
\toption is given.

-s, --settings: Opens a dialog to write out a configuration file. The
\tlocation of the Cpython executable and the folder where all scripts
\tare located can be given. Use full path names for this, i.e., use
\t'/usr/bin/python3' for *nix instead of 'python3' or '~/folder/python3',
\tand 'C:\python.exe' for Windows (note the .exe) extension. If the
\tconfiguration file already exists, the entries will be verified and
\tthe dialog will be populated with them if these are found to be correct.
\tElse, an error message with the configuration file will be returned and
\tthe dialogs will be kept empty.

-n, --name: Opens a dialog box to give the path of a script to be run

-c, --config: Prints contents of the configuration file, if it exists.
\tIf no configuration file is found, it prints 'None'

-d, --dry-run: Prints out the command that will be executed by the subprocess
\tmodule if this option is not given.

--no-args: Does not pass any arguments (current data folder, etc) to
\tthe external program

--use-shell: Uses shell to run the subprocess command. By default, this is
\tnot used for *nix, but is used for Windows. [Warning: this is a known
\tsecurity risk and users are advised to be careful with their input]
