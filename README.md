# Peakipy - NMR peak integration/deconvolution using python

![Test](https://github.com/j-brady/peakipy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

[peakipy documentation](https://j-brady.github.io/peakipy)

## Description

Simple deconvolution of NMR peaks for extraction of intensities. Provided an NMRPipe format spectrum (2D or Pseudo 3D)
 and a peak list (NMRPipe, Sparky or Analysis2), overlapped peaks are automatically/interactively clustered and groups
 of overlapped peaks are fitted together using Gaussian, Lorentzian or Pseudo-Voigt (Gaussian + Lorentzian) lineshape.

## Installation

The easiest way to install peakipy is with poetry...

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/j-brady/peakipy.git
cd peakipy; poetry install
```

If you don't have poetry please refer to the [poetry documentation](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/) for more details

At this point the package should be installed and the main scripts (`peakipy read`, `peakipy edit`, `peakipy fit` and `peakipy check`)
should have been added to your path.

## Inputs

1. Peak list (NMRPipe, Analysis v2.4, Sparky) 
2. NMRPipe frequency domain dataset (2D or Pseudo 3D)

There are four main commands:

1. `peakipy read` converts your peak list and selects clusters of peaks.
2. `peakipy edit` is used to check and adjust fit parameters interactively (i.e clusters and mask radii) if initial clustering is not satisfactory.
3. `peakipy fit` fits clusters of peaks.
4. `peakipy check` is used to check individual fits or groups of fits and make plots.

You can use the `-h` or `--help` flags for instructions on how to run the programs (e.g. peakipy read -h)


## Outputs

1. Pandas DataFrame containing fitted intensities/linewidths/centers etc.

etc...
```

2. If `--plot=<path>` option selected the first plane of each fit will be plotted in <path> with the files named according to the cluster ID (clustid) of the fit. Adding `--show` option calls `plt.show()` on each fit so you can see what it looks like. However, using `peakipy check` should be preferable since plotting the fits during fitting
slows down the process a lot.

3. To plot fits for all planes or interactively check them you can run `peakipy check`

```bash
peakipy check fits.csv test.ft2 --dims=0,1,2 --clusters=1,10,20 --show --outname=plot.pdf
```
Will plot clusters 1,10 and 20 showing each plane in an interactive matplotlib window and save the plots to a multipage pdf called plot.pdf. Calling `peakipy check`
with the `--first` flag results in only the first plane of each fit being plotted.

Run `peakipy check -h` for more options.

You can explore the output data conveniently with `pandas`.

```python
In [1]: import pandas as pd

In [2]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

In [3]: data = pd.read_csv("fits.csv")

In [4]: groups = data.groupby("assignment")

In [5]: for ind, group in groups:
   ...:     plt.errorbar(group.vclist,group.amp,yerr=group.amp_err,fmt="o",label=group.assignment.iloc[0])
   ...:     plt.legend()
   ...:     plt.show()
```

## Pseudo-Voigt model

![Pseudo-Voigt](images/equations/pv.tex.png)

Where Gaussian lineshape is

![G](images/equations/G.tex.png)

And Lorentzian is

![L](images/equations/L.tex.png)

The fit minimises the residuals of the functions in each dimension

![PV_xy](images/equations/pv_xy.tex.png)

Fraction parameter is fraction of Lorentzian lineshape.

The linewidth for the G lineshape is

![G_lw](images/equations/G_lw.tex.png)

The linewidth for PV and L lineshapes is

![PV FWHM](images/equations/pv_lw.png)

## Test data

Download from git repo. To test the program for yourself `cd` into the `test` directory . I wrote some tests for the code itself which should be run from the top directory like so `python test/test_core.py`.

## Comparison with NMRPipe

A sanity check... Peak intensities were fit using the nlinLS program from NMRPipe and compared with the output from peakipy for the same dataset.

## Homage to FuDA

If you would rather use FuDA then try running `peakipy read` with the `--fuda` flag to create a FuDA parameter file
(params.fuda) and peak list (peaks.fuda).
This should hopefully save you some time on configuration.
