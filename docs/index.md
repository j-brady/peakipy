# Say hello to peakipy!

Simple deconvolution of NMR peaks for extraction of intensities.
Provided an NMRPipe format spectrum (2D or Pseudo 3D) and a peak list
(NMRPipe, Sparky or Analysis2), overlapped peaks are
automatically/interactively clustered and groups of overlapped peaks are
fitted together using Gaussian, Lorentzian or Pseudo-Voigt (Gaussian +
Lorentzian) lineshape.
