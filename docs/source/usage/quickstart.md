Quickstart instructions
=======================

Inputs
------

1.  Peak list (see `instructions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"})
2.  NMRPipe frequency domain dataset (2D or Pseudo 3D)

There are four main scripts.

1.  `peakipy read` converts your peak list into a `.csv` file and
    selects clusters of peaks.
2.  `peakipy edit` is used to check and adjust fit parameters
    interactively (i.e clusters and mask radii) if initial clustering is
    not satisfactory.
3.  `peakipy fit` fits clusters of peaks using the `.csv` peak list
    generated (or edited) by the `read (edit)` script(s).
4.  `peakipy check` is used to check individual fits or groups of fits
    and make plots.

Head to the `instructions`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} section for a
description of how to run these scripts. You can also use the `-h` or
`--help` flags for instructions on how to run the programs from the
command line (e.g `peakipy read -h`).
