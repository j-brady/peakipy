Say hello to peakipy!
=====================

Simple deconvolution of NMR peaks for extraction of intensities.
Provided an NMRPipe format spectrum (2D or Pseudo 3D) and a peak list (NMRPipe, Sparky or Analysis2), overlapped peaks are automatically/interactively clustered and groups of overlapped peaks are fitted together using Gaussian, Lorentzian or Pseudo-Voigt (Gaussian + Lorentzian) lineshape.
